## logseq-time-tracker-plugin

## Core Features
> The **_time tracked_** and **_total time tracked_** are inserted as a block property in the following notation: `hours:minutes:seconds` (e.g. 00:17:32 â†’ 17 minutes and 32 seconds)

### Start and stop tracking time for a <u>_new_</u> or <u>_existing_</u> task in 3 ways:
- Block context menu (right-click on bullet)
- Plugin UI
    - New tasks created via the plugin UI are added to the daily journal page by default (but can be added to a specific page) and can be prepended with your preferred workflow (e.g. TODO/NOW) - these features can be configured in the [settings](#settings)
- Slash (/) command  
#### Demo

### Get and update the total time tracked for a parent task with child(ren) tasks in 2 ways:
- Block context menu (right-click on bullet)
- Slash (/) command  
- After getting the total time tracked for the first time, an inline refresh button will appear to make it easier to update the total time tracked (the color and position of the button can be configured in the [settings](#settings))
    - ðŸš¨&ensp; <u>**NOTE:**</u> Always use the block context menu or slash command to get the inital total time tracked. Please do **NOT** copy and paste `{{renderer :refreshTotalTimeTracked}}` to other blocks.

## Extra Features
> These features are **_disabled by default_** and can be configured in the [settings](#settings).

### Show log entries that mirror Logseq's native time tracking functionality

### Get notified after a customizable interval of time
- Similar to a pomodoro timer - a **"ding"** sound will play and/or a **system notification** will appear at the end of _**each**_ interval (e.g. every 25 minutes), but the stopwatch will continue to track time until you stop the timer

## Settings
- Each time you make changes to the plugin settings, please reload the plugin to ensure that all settings are updated.
